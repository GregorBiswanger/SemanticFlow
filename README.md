# Semantic Flow

**Semantic Flow** is a powerful state manager and a game-changer in the orchestration of generative AI workflows. Designed to simplify complex processes, reduce costs, and increase efficiency, it enables you to break down intricate AI-driven workflows into manageable, self-contained steps - known as **Activities** - through a modular architecture perfectly aligned with the **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**.

## üöÄ Why Semantic Flow?

**Traditional AI workflow orchestration is inefficient. Semantic Flow changes that.**

1. **Overwhelming System Prompts**  
   - Long prompts lead to increased costs due to excessive token usage.  
   - They overload the model with irrelevant information, which decreases efficiency and accuracy.  
   - **Semantic Flow solves this by dividing large prompts into smaller, specialized system prompts for each activity, optimizing both performance and cost.**

2. **One Model for Everything**  
   - A single model is often inefficient and expensive for diverse tasks.  
   - **With Semantic Flow, each activity can use the most suitable model - whether it`s GPT-3.5 Turbo for simpler tasks or GPT-4 for more complex ones.**

3. **Unnecessary Registered Plugins / Kernel Functions**  
   - In traditional approaches, all available functions are often registered, regardless of whether they are needed.  
   - This increases latency, costs, and complexity.  
   - **Semantic Flow registers only the functions that are truly relevant to the current activity.**

4. **Complex Software Architecture**  
   - Without a clear structure, the code quickly becomes convoluted and hard to maintain.  
   - **Semantic Flow brings order with a clean, modular architecture.**

5. **Manual State Tracking**  
   - Developers often need to manually track the conversation context.  
   - **Semantic Flow uses the WorkflowState service to automatically save progress and make it accessible.**

## üîç How Does Semantic Flow Work?

**Imagine building a complex AI-driven process** - such as an order system, customer interaction, or data analysis. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and efficiency. Semantic Flow revolutionizes this by breaking the process into **manageable steps**, called **Activities**.

### What is an Activity?

Activities are the **atomic building blocks** of Semantic Flow. Each activity is:

- üß© **Independent:** Focused on a single, well-defined task.  
- ‚ö° **Customizable:** Designed to include only what`s needed for the current task, reducing overhead and cost:  
  1. **Own System Prompt:** Contains only the relevant information for this task.  
  2. **Own Model:** Each activity can use a different model (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama).  
  3. **Own Settings:** Model parameters like temperature, token limit, etc., can be configured individually.  
  4. **Own Kernel Functions:** Only the relevant functions for the current step are registered.

### Example: Pizza Order Workflow

![Pizza Order Workflow](https://github.com/GregorBiswanger/SemanticFlow/raw/main/assets/semantic-flow-workflow-sample.png)

In a pizza ordering workflow, the activities might look like this:

1. **Customer Identification Activity**: Identifies the customer.  
2. **Menu Selection Activity**: The customer selects a pizza.  
3. **Payment Processing Activity**: Payment is processed.  
4. **Order Confirmation Activity**: The order is confirmed.

Each activity works with its **own prompts, models, and functions**, ensuring the entire process is optimized and executed precisely.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 or later  
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel  

Semantic Flow is available via [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/SemanticFlow?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SemanticFlow/)

```bash
dotnet add package SemanticFlow
```

## üõ† Getting Started

### 1. Configure the Workflow

Set up the workflow by defining a sequence of activities:

```csharp
// You need Semantic Kernel
builder.Services.AddKernel()
    .AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(deployment, endpoint, apiKey, modelId: "gpt-4")
    .AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(deployment, endpoint, apiKey, modelId: "gpt-35-turbo");

// Setup from Semantic Flow
services.AddKernelWorkflow()
    .StartWith<CustomerIdentificationActivity>()
    .Then<MenuSelectionActivity>()
    .Then<PaymentProcessingActivity>()
    .EndsWith<OrderConfirmationActivity>();
```

### 2. Create an Activity

Define a custom activity, including its prompt, model, and logic:

```csharp
public class CustomerIdentificationActivity : IActivity
{
    public string SystemPrompt { get; set; } = "Please identify the customer based on their input.";
    public PromptExecutionSettings PromptExecutionSettings { get; set; } = new PromptExecutionSettings
    {
        ModelId = "gpt-35-turbo",
        Temperature = 0.7
    };

    [KernelFunction]
    public string IdentifyCustomer(string input)
    {
        return $"Customer identified: {input}";
    }
}
```

### 3. Start the Workflow

Start the workflow and retrieve the current activity:

```csharp
var workflowService = kernel.GetRequiredService<WorkflowService>();
var currentActivity = workflowService.GetCurrentActivity("session-id", kernel);
```

### 4. Retrieve Workflow State

Access the workflow state at any time:

```csharp
var stateService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<WorkflowStateService>();
var state = stateService.DataFrom("session-id");
```

### 5. Complete Activity

Complete an activity and transition to the next step:

```csharp
var workflowService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<WorkflowService>();
var nextActivity = workflowService.CompleteActivity("session-id", dataFromUser, kernel);
```
